\section{REVISION HISTORY}

\subsection{Changes with respect to version 1.0}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The tag {\bf DiagonalizationSwitch} no longer supports option 2
  - Conjugate gradient method + FFT. As a result, {\bf TBPW} does not
  need the FFTW library.
\item The value for the tag {\bf LminAndLmax} does not need to be specified in the input file explictly. It is determined by the program at run time.
\item Tag {\bf Channel} renamed to {\bf NumChannelsPerSpecie}.
\item Introduction of new tag {\bf TightBindingModelType}.
\end{enumerate}
